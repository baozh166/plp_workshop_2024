# Day 1 Case Study: Mining genomic data for pathogen identification and virulence factors
In this case study on virulence effector identification from genomic data, we are going to utilize the interactive Google Colab platform. 

## What is Colab:
Colab, or "Colaboratory", allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with 
- Zero configuration required
- Access to GPUs free of charge
- Easy sharing

Read the [Welcome to Colab!](https://colab.research.google.com/#scrollTo=Nma_JWh-W-IF) page or Watch [Introduction to Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to learn more.

Additionally, [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNgswRZ2C1Y) shared the following features of Colab, which can be very useful when testing and running codes.
  1. Execution History (under the View menu):
     - View executed code history to see what has been run so far.
     - Can go back and re-examine any specific step.
     - Open up a scratch cell to try new things with this code cell without changing the original notebook.
  2. Command Palette (under the Tools menu or cntl+shift+P):
     - Quick access to search for functions and features.
  3. Interactive Table (need to enable this extension on the data table module):
     - Increase efficiency with tabular data like Pandas DataFrames.

In this case study, we should have everything we need in the provided files, but feel free to learn more about this platform by watching more videos available online.

## How to open and use the files provided (for new users of Google Colab):
1. Register or login into your Google account
2. Search/ Go to the [Google Colab Notebook website](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) and upload the downloaded IPython Notebook **introduction.ipynb**, now you should be viewing the notebook in Colab.
3. On the left side of the screen, find **Files** and you may see a **sample_data** folder if this is your first time using Google Colab.
4. Upload the downloaded **PF03377.hmm** and **list_gi** files. (You can choose to make a new folder to store all files used in this case study, just remember to adjust the path to call these files later in the notebook.)
5. Now you are ready to run the code cells of the **introduction.ipynb**!
6. Additional tip on installing packages at the beginning: you may need to type 'y' to proceed with package installation.
