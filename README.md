The workshop focused on bioinformatics analysis and the application of machine learning in plant pathology. This introductory course is designed for beginners and aims to familiarize participants with utilizing big data analysis concepts in their research endeavors. No prior experience is required. Participants will learn how to interact with large datasets, utilize computer clusters effectively, create electronic notebooks, and develop pipelines for analysis.

The course spans two days. 

Day 1: Fundamentals of applied bioinformatics with case study: Mining genomic data for pathogen identification and virulence factors  

In this module, participants will dive into genomic data analysis. Through hands-on exercises, they will learn to utilize Unix commands and basic Python programming to construct Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for mining genetic databases. Emphasis will be placed on identifying and classifying virulence factors crucial for understanding pathogen behavior.

Day 2: Machine learning fundamentals and its applications with case studies

The second module focuses on machine learning and image recognition fundamentals. Participants will explore concepts such as linear regression and image classification techniques. Through practical demonstrations, they will develop skills to classify and identify features within image datasets. Additionally, participants can create customized tools or pipelines tailored to their specific research needs or projects.
